Present voting systems and voting developments seem to be on the wrong track. The pressure from the public and politicians to have mobile internet voting could end democracies in many contexts. It is not far-fetched to compare existing e-voting solutions to a single ballot box for a nation managed by a small elite. An uncompromised voting alternative system is vitally necessary to change direction and improve democratic decision-making in ways not previously possible with a paper ballot. This is what PeaceFounder stands for:

  * A strong software-independent voting system where mistakes are an opportunity to learn and can be monitored with publicly available data;
    * Trusted party-free design with public auditability and complete transparency;
    * Unstoppable, monitorable and defendable elections by third parties;
    * Accessible trust for voters. Every voter can see their vote is cast as intended and counted as cast and can do vote counting and auditing elections themselves.

  * Privacy through a cascade of mixes runs one at a time and does not need to be trusted or coordinated; 
  * Versatile and innovative ballots:
    * cardinal, preferential voting;
    * complex ballots with budget constraints;
    * sampled ballots where a large ballot is split into smaller ones and assigned verifiably random to anonymous voters reducing repetitive work and amplifying each voter's responsibility;
    * the ability for voters to change their votes after elections making untrusted representatives lose their seats and making them more accountable to society.
  * Made with integration into existing webpages, forums in mind;
  * Extendable with specialised hardware to support coercion resistance.

In summary, if you use an e-voting solution on a website, you will benefit in transparency, security and privacy by using PeaceFounder with little to lose in usability.
