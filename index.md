# Vision


Present voting systems and voting developments seem to be on the wrong track. The pressure from the public and politicians to have mobile internet voting could end democracies in many countries. It is not far-fetched to compare them to a single ballot box for a nation managed by a small elite. An uncompromised voting alternative system is vitally necessary to change tracks and improve democratic decision-making in ways not previously possible with a paper ballot. This is what PeaceFounder stands for:

  * A strong software-independent voting system where mistakes are an opportunity to learn and can be monitored with publicly available data
  * Privacy is ensured through a cascade of mixes which do not need to be trusted, and one of them can be your desktop computer
  * Versatile and innovative ballots:
    * cardinal, preferential voting is possible
    * complex ballots with budget constraints
    * statistical ballots where a large ballot is split into smaller ones and assigned verifiably random to anonymous voters reducing repetitive work and amplifying each voter's responsibility
    * ability for voters to change their votes after elections making untrusted representatives lose their seats and making them more accountable to society
  * Accessible trust for voters. Every voter can see their vote is cast as intended and counted as cast and can do vote counting and auditing elections themselves.
  * Trusted party-free design.
  * Unstoppable and defendable elections by third parties.
  * Extendable with specialised hardware to support coercion resistance.
