### How to get in touch?

The project currently does have only one developer: Janis Erdmanis. You can get in touch with me at janiserdmanis@protonmail.ch I will be happy to chat about whatever may be related to this project. 

### Why Julia?

Many legacy software in cryptography is written in C, C++ and Java, making them an obvious choice for implementing an e-voting system. However, these languages have shown their age in the presence of innovations in code reuse and its deployment like Rust, Go, Swift, Julia etc. However, Julia may seem least desirable as it lacks considerable amount of cryptographic libraries such as CryptoGroups.jl, CryptoSignatiures.jl and HistoryTrees.jl which would be already been available in Rust and Go from a start.

The reason for choosing Julia can partly be attributed to my familiarity with the language. As a PhD student, I spent the ins and outs of effective Julia codebase management and got addicted to the multiple dispatch and corresponding type system. Objectively speaking, Julia offers everything that a modern language like Rust, Go, and Swift could offer in terms of development speed and deployment of code. But in addition, it does offer great opportunities to experiment with the ability to use a type system for making code more modular, with multiple dispatch and Unicode allowing to make code as lean as possible, closely resembling pseudocodes in the papers. And the worry-free compatibility between platforms and Julia versions is a great plus. For instance, ShuffleProofs.jl was developed using Julia 1.7 as a testing platform; however, with no changes, it works with no issues, also on Julia 1.0, now a 4-year-old version. 

In future, though its dynamism of Julia may become less attractive when the protocol is stabilised, targeting mobile will become relevant. However, that is far years ahead until such a problem would rise, and development within the Julia community, in a sense, is pushing in that direction with StaticCompiler.jl and BinaryBuilder.jl. Thus in the meantime, letâ€™s have fun :) 

### How does PeaceFounder compare with XYZ?

PeaceFounder aims to raise verifiability to a new level by providing conclusive public evidence that elections have happened fairly. To achieve this goal, a zero-knowledge proof of shuffle for encryption shuffle takes a central part of the design to get this evidence. The same proof system has been used in elections before in shuffling votes for re-encryption mixnet voting system pipeline. 

A typical re-encryption voting system makes conclusive evidence for election integrity but closes that behind the doors and is available only to auditors with special access. We could place the Estonian election system and other state-wide systems in this category where the Verificatum system has been used. I added another column to see what happens if all evidence in such a system is published. A Helios voting system could fit into this category, providing an explicit "Coerce Me" button.

The colours green, yellow, and red are relative measures of how well a corresponding property for a voting system is achieved compared to alternatives. Note also that this is a subjective selection of frame and evaluation. For instance, participation privacy may be undesirable when a law obligates citizens to vote, like in Australia or requires them to know who had participated. 

### How does the PeaceFounder system protect against vote selling and coercion? 

Coercion resistance can be implemented by allowing voters to revote and keep it a secret that they have done so. When counting the votes, those who have voted at the pooling station can be substracted by the ellection authorithy from a public ledger. It's also possible to do this remotely and add different cross-accountability mechanisms, but now that is out of the scope of the PeaceFounder project. Also, to do that properly, one would need to add hardware so that coercers could not extract voters secret keys. 

An alternative way to look at coercion resistance is through a way an individual could protect his/her voters privacy. The ability to whistleblow anonymously in case one offers to buy a vote or has heard about that from a friend could enable easier investigation. Sharding of long ballots can prevent the briber from reaching the key voters who decide on a sensitive question. Also, voting more often could make life more inconvenient for coercers, and bribers as a single ballot would have less stake in it.
