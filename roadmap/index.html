Intuitive voting experience while ensuring seamless deployment and maintenance is a priority. Balancing a user-centric design with the highest standards of security, transparency, and privacy is a commitment of the PeaceFounder project, even when these goals are in tension with each other. Every detail reflects our dedication to excellence, a journey thus far curated by a singular, dedicated vision.</p> <p>In April 2023, a milestone was reached where all cryptographic elements were integrated, paving the way for a unified voting system, which can be checked out in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L7M0FG50ulU">a 10-minute demo</a>. Since then, significant progress has been made by bundling client GUI clients, improving the installation experience and creating an admin panel, making the system much more accessible to a wider audience:</p> <iframe width=560  height=315  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3asNuNMlHhY?si=xFw0NHC3E92FA3W1" title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe> <p>The demonstration video captures the project&#39;s potential, emphasising its early-stage nature. It already shows a streamlined and intuitive workflow for the guardian. Now, the next step is going to be a focus on audibility and transparency where braid chain and bulletin board records can be serialised in a disk and verified with a common interface and streamlining record distribution, in particular to a GitHub repository which is also going to serve as bulletin board accessible to voters themselves where voters can also verify that their votes to have been cast as intended. </p> <p>Looking ahead, mobile phones have become indispensable for daily tasks; we aspire to make the voting system readily accessible on these devices. A significant step in this direction is transitioning the client backend to Rust. Not only would Rust offer complete compilation, but its compatibility with the Arti library &#40;which wraps TOR&#41; is crucial for offering intractability for the voters. This move is especially pertinent given the uncertainty surrounding Julia&#39;s adaptability for mobile app integrations in the foreseeable future.</p> <p>Here are the key milestones we&#39;re gearing up to address, beginning with the immediate goal of expanding PeaceFounder&#39;s accessibility to a wider user base:</p> <p><strong>1. Making the PeaceFounder Ready for Early Adopters</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><strong>&#91;DONE&#93; Administrator GUI Interface</strong>: Intuitive control panel for publishing proposals, inviting new members via email and initiating braiding.</p> <li><p><strong>&#91;DONE&#93; Client Installation</strong>: Make client bundles for macOS, Linux, and Windows.</p> <li><p><strong>Server &amp; Client Error Handling</strong>: Robust error and assertion handling in both PeaceFounder server and client, with client errors clearly displayed for users. Features blame forwarding to auditors for accountability.</p> <li><p><strong>Data Persistence</strong>: Client and server data storage.</p> <li><p><strong>Membership Termination:</strong> Membership termination is essential in various scenarios for long-standing demes. This is challenging to do as the link between pseudonyms and identity is secret; therefore, braiding needs to be reset from the original generator while maintaining practicality with a pinch of trust. <a href="https://github.com/PeaceFounder/PeaceFounder.jl/issues/18">issue #18</a> </p> </ul> <p><strong>2. Auditing &amp; Accountability Features</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Evidence Auditing with Terminal API:</strong> Create a CLI application that allows any party to audit and reproduce the announced tally independently. <a href="https://github.com/PeaceFounder/PeaceFounder.jl/issues/19">issue #19</a></p> <li><p><strong>Bulletin Board Facade</strong>: Develop a bulletin board facade as a static website where voters can easily confirm their votes have been recorded as intended in the ballot box. <a href="https://github.com/PeaceFounder/PeaceFounder.jl/issues/22">issue #22</a>, <a href="https://github.com/PeaceFounder/PeaceFounder.jl/issues/21">issue #21</a></p> <li><p><strong>Vote Proxy Feature</strong>: Simplify the process for users to set up a proxy, ensuring vote accountability.</p> <li><p><strong>Vote Selection Encryption:</strong> Encryption of vote selection could provide another measure to protect the fairness of the election result, enable vote tagging as coerced and ensure imparity when votes are collected by a third party for forwarding. <a href="https://github.com/PeaceFounder/PeaceFounder.jl/issues/16">issue #16</a></p> <li><p><strong>Sampled Electoral Roll Audits:</strong> Auditing a selective sample of the electoral roll can balance election integrity with the risk of data leaks, ensuring reliability and broadening independent oversight. <a href="https://github.com/PeaceFounder/PeaceFounder.jl/issues/17">issue #17</a></p> </ul> <p><strong>3. Integration of External Braiding Services</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Deme Anonymisation</strong>: Demes can run braiding by establishing direct connections with other demes.</p> <li><p><strong>Braiding Broker</strong>: An automatic braiding from a curated list of demes managed by PeaceFounder. This feature will be the primary monetisation avenue in the later stages.</p> <li><p><strong>Braiding Protocol Finalization</strong>: Establish and finalise the underlying braiding protocol to ensure seamless integration and functionality.</p> </ul> <p><strong>4. Mobile Client Development</strong></p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Vote Tracking Protection</strong>: Leverage the Arti project to prevent backtracking of votes to individual voters.</p> <li><p><strong>Data Specification</strong>: Establish a specification for the canonical forms of signed data which are exchanged with a client.</p> <li><p><strong>Backend Implementation</strong>: Craft the client&#39;s backend in Rust, ensuring compatibility with the pre-existing QML interface.</p> <li><p><strong>History Tree Synchronization</strong>: Implement the history tree in Julia to align with the Rust version, ensuring consistency across platforms.</p> </ul> <p><em>Note: As we journey through these milestones, PeaceFounder remains committed to continuous improvement and will regularly update this roadmap to reflect our latest endeavours.</em></p> <h2 id=important_subprojects ><a href="#important_subprojects" class=header-anchor >Important SubProjects</a></h2> <p>The PeaceFounder project relies on a substantial amount of cryptography, which was designed and implemented in Julia. </p> <h3 id=cryptogroupsjl ><a href="#cryptogroupsjl" class=header-anchor >CryptoGroups.jl</a></h3> <p>CryptoGroups offers a high-level abstraction for cryptographic groups, with support for both modular prime numbers and elliptic curves. Currently, the project lacks comprehensive documentation. This is partly due to its wide-ranging features, which include ElGamal types, calculations for verifiable random generator vectors, cryptographic pseudorandom number generators, and the management and choice of several elliptic curve parameters. As a result, the project has an extensive API. In an ideal scenario, each of these functionalities would reside in its own distinct package, complete with a dedicated API and set of responsibilities. It seems that a collaborative community effort to modularise these components from the PeaceFounder project would be the most natural next step.</p> <p>A pressing concern is the performance of elliptic curves. There are several avenues for improvement in this area. One approach could involve wrapping existing implementations from languages like C or Rust. Alternatively, introducing projective coordinates for elliptic curves might enhance their efficiency. Additionally, profiling the code to adopt a more optimised data layout could yield significant improvements.</p> <h3 id=cryptosignaturesjl ><a href="#cryptosignaturesjl" class=header-anchor >CryptoSignatures.jl</a></h3> <p>CryptoSignatures offers means to form cryptographic signatures which are compliant with FIPS standards. In contrast to many cryptographic libraries, the API emphasises purity. Easiness of signing and verifying messages with a custom generator is also easily accessible as it is used further in PeaceFounder.jl to sign votes with a pseudonym. </p> <p>Further directions in this project could add RSA and blind signatures. Adding more test vectors would not hurt either. All performance bottlenecks are within CryptoGroups.jl </p> <h3 id=shuffleproofsjl ><a href="#shuffleproofsjl" class=header-anchor >ShuffleProofs.jl</a></h3> <p>A proof of shuffle is implemented, but it could benefit from being polished, particularly for inputting from and outputting to files.</p> <iframe width=560  height=315  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2P2FBP47b8c" title="YouTube video player" frameborder=0  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe> <p>Now, shuffle proofs also support decryption proofs and the formation of knot-like structures braids with a bluntly foolproof interface <code>braid&#40;g, Y, verifier&#41;</code>. This hides all the complexity of zero-knowledge proofs in a pure interface executed on a single computer, making the PeaceFounder system greatly more understandable than existing alternatives.</p> <h3 id=historytreesjl ><a href="#historytreesjl" class=header-anchor >HistoryTrees.jl</a></h3> <p>HistoryTrees implements unbalanced Merkle tree hashing usable for any bulletin board or tamper evident logging implementation. An implementation for append-only data structure and efficient leaf and root inclusion proofs is available with the spirit of RFC6962 and RFC9162. </p> <p>A further improvement could be made on keeping a cache on roots of even powers, making proof generation more efficient. Also, making the proofs compatible with Rust and Go implementations is one of the pressing tasks for implementing a client application in Rust.</p> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > &copy; Janis Erdmanis.
