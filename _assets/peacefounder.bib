	abstract = {Electronic voting systems are those which depend on some electronic technology for their correct functionality. Many of them depend on such technology for the communication of election data. Depending on one or more communication channels in order to run elections poses many technical challenges with respect to veriﬁability, dependability, security, anonymity and trust. Changing the way in which people vote has many social and political implications. The role of election administrators and (independent) observers is fundamentally diﬀerent when complex communications technology is involved in the process. Electronic voting has been deployed in many diﬀerent types of election throughout the world for several decades. Despite lack of agreement on whether this has been a 'success', there has been - in the last few years - enormous investment in remote electronic voting (primarily as a means of exploiting the internet as the underlying communication technology).},

	abstract = {This paper defines and explores the notion of 'software independence' in voting systems: 'A voting system is software independent if an (undetected) change or error in its software cannot cause an undetectable change or error in an election outcome'. For example, optical scan and some cryptographically based voting systems are software independent. Variations and implications of this definition are explored. It is proposed that software-independent voting systems should be preferred, and software-dependent voting systems should be avoided.

An initial version of this paper was prepared for use by the Technical Guidelines Development Committee in their development of the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines, which will specify the requirements that the {USA} voting systems must meet to receive certification.},

Such a methodology reveals important differences in security properties between the classes and allows for selection and future design of voting schemes, based on application requirements. We illustrate the use of our framework by analyzing some of the existing electronic voting schemes.},
