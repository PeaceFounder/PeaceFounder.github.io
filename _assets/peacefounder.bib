	abstract = {Voters are understandably concerned about election security. News reports of possible election interference by foreign powers, of unauthorized voting, of voter disenfranchisement, and of technological failures call into question the integrity of elections worldwide. This article examines the suggestions that “voting over the Internet” or “voting on the blockchain” would increase election security, and ﬁnds such claims to be wanting and misleading. While current election systems are far from perfect, Internet- and blockchain-based voting would greatly increase the risk of undetectable, nation-scale election failures. Online voting may seem appealing: voting from a computer or smartphone may seem convenient and accessible. However, studies have been inconclusive, showing that online voting may have little to no effect on turnout in practice, and it may even increase disenfranchisement. More importantly, given the current state of computer security, any turnout increase derived from Internet- or blockchain-based voting would come at the cost of losing meaningful assurance that votes have been counted as they were cast, and not undetectably altered or discarded. This state of affairs will continue as long as standard tactics such as malware, zero day, and denial-of-service attacks continue to be effective. This article analyzes and systematizes prior research on the security risks of online and electronic voting, and shows that not only do these risks persist in blockchain-based voting systems, but blockchains may introduce ‘additional’ problems for voting systems. Finally, we suggest questions for critically assessing security risks of new voting system proposals.},

These clusters are security, privacy, fairness and accountability. Each cluster consists of a range of further values, which can be viewed as articulating specific moral reasons relevant when devising cybersecurity measures. In addition to the four value clusters, domain-­ specific values that are served by computer systems, such as health, are important. Following a detailed discussion of the four relevant value clusters, potential value conflicts and value tensions are considered. The relationships of five pairs of values (privacy-security, privacy-fairness, privacy-accountability, security-accountability and security-fairness) are analysed in terms of whether they are largely supportive or conflicting. In addition, possible methods for addressing these potential value conflicts are discussed. It is concluded that values, and value conflicts, in cybersecurity should be considered in context, also taking into account the specific computer systems at play, to enable the use of nuanced and fine-grained methods for addressing the relevant value conflicts.},

The stakes are high; the context is adversarial; the electorate needs to be convinced that the results are correct; and the secrecy of the ballot must be ensured. And they have practical constraints: time is of the essence, and voting systems need to be affordable and maintainable, and usable by voters, election ofﬁcials, and pollworkers. It is thus not surprising that voting is a rich research area spanning theory, applied cryptography, practical systems analysis, usable security, and statistics. Election integrity involves two key concepts: convincing evidence that outcomes are correct and privacy, which amounts to convincing assurance that there is no evidence about how any given person voted. These are obviously in tension. We examine how current systems walk this tightrope.},

	abstract = {A proof of a shuffle is a zero-knowledge proof that one list of ciphertexts is a permutation and re-encryption of another list of ciphertexts. We call a shuffle restricted if the permutation is chosen from a public subset of all permutations. In this paper, we introduce a general technique for constructing proofs of shuffles which restrict the permutation to a group that is characterized by a public polynomial. This generalizes previous work by Reiter and Wang [22], and de Hoogh et al. [7].},
