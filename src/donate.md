# Donate

The PeaceFounder organization believes that a solution which can make the world more democratic has no right to be possessed. We can only benefit from being the caretakers of the idea for it to grow and prosper. PeaceFounder organization is the benevolent parent of the electronic voting system PeaceVote. Currently, PeaceFounder is understaffed and underfunded with respect to concrete tasks which needs to be done for first to make PeaceVote mobile application available for smartphones and desktops. This is why we ask your support to achieve our ambition of making the world a more democratic place. 

We also believe that the spending of donations should be decided in a democratic process within the members of PeaceFounder's organization to achieve the maximum efficiency of your donation and to lead by example how leadership, ability and passion to do good for society could be enough to sustain any democratic organization. 

A non-profit account had not yet been made as the organization is still being founded. Please contact me `janiserdmanis at protonmail ch` for your willingness to donate. That would help me to gauge time when to officially found the organization.
