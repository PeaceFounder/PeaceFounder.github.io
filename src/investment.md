# For Investors

The PeaceFounder organization believes that no good had come to the world from finance. Furthermore, we believe that it is the main obstacle to fight climate change. Thus for this organization, we are the ones who will select you.

## We offer:

+ To exchange your monetary capital into labour power; thus, you would protect yourself from a possible (hyper)inflation.
+ For the invested labour-power (measured in terms of entry-level programmer hours in PeaceFounder), we will pay you up to 20% in revenues every year.
+ First hand on what to do with the revenue up to 20% of the investment. But no property rights for the company.
+ A possibility to inherit the obligation. Selling will not be possible for a third person, but possible to sell the obligation back to the company.
+ Participation in investor democracy. A possibility to elect a representative for managing bussiness decissions.

## The dynamics:

+ As we grow and get richer, our entry-level programmer salary will grow. That would make the returns on the investment to grow. 
+ As our employees get richer, they would start to buy the obligations of the company. Thus initial investors would likely become a minority with time.
