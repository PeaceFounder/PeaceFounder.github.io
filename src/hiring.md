# Looking for talent

I am looking for people who recognize innovation and are resistant to hype. Who has a curiosity about the world not limited to a narrow academic discipline background. I am looking for you who dares to disobey to fulfil the need for integrity. And for a set of skills:

+ Experience on the open-source project in Rust or Julia
+ For Rust - iOS and Android app development, chip-on card development.
+ Understanding of some cryptography
+ A healthy analytical and open mind. 
+ A clear understanding of the reasons why Europe and the world fall in the fascism. 
+ Had read at least one thick book which you can discuss in relation with the  PeaceFounder organization.
