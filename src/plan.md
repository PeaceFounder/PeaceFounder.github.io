# The master plan 

Currently, I am in the early stages of founding a non-profit organization PeaceFounder which develops and spreads open-source electronic voting system PeaceVote. That consists of a keyserver which maintainer runs on the raspberry pi to do a shared ballot protocol for collecting anonymous public keys. A vote collector server which accepts signatures made from the anonymous public key ledger and immediately lets everyone to download them. (There is no problem to run them on the same device). A community git repository where everyone can access the code for vote-counting, where policy for getting the proposal on the table is established and where the infrastructure is established (public keys of servers and maintainers). And lastly, a smartphone application which allows subscribing to the communities, have an anonymous discussion there, getting active proposals and vote. 

At the moment a prototype for the keyserver is close to the completion.  To proceed, I need either my time, inspired people or disposable capital.  The steps for the master plan for taking over the world is:

1. Finish the keyserver prototype and make a demonstration of that. (2 or 3 weeks depending on when I will feel rested)
2. Find a person who could illustrate the PeaceVote electronic voting platform. 
3. Find inspired people who wish to contribute to the vision of the PeaceFounder organization as well as the potential user base.
4. Found the organization. Hire or inspire capable Julia and Rust programmers for building and polishing the rest of the PeaceVote voting system.
5. Publish a smartphone application PeaceVote in the Android and iOS store. As well make a desktop application accessible. 
6. Find and convince communities to use PeaceVote. 

One would know that the plan is succesfull when:

1. PeaceVote would take place of the social media
2. People would voluntary pay subscription fees for communities and would collectively decide uppon the common spending
3. The laws of the state would be influenced by the vote of communities. When existance of countries would no longer be a necessity to protect minorities. 
4. When there would be a voluntary world democracy which would adress, for example, world poverty and climate crisis. 
5. When every person would care and take part of a local community democratic process.
6. When John Lennon song Imagine would become the reality of the world.
