# Roadmap

PeaceFounder is an evoting system which relies on advanced developments in cryptography/privacy. It relies on zero knowledge proof of shuffle implemented in ShuffleProofs.jl as well as the ability to anonymously access buletinboard and send messages to it for consideration to avoid being tracked by IP address. For traffic anonymization wrapping of existing solutions such as TOR is planned at the end stages of the project. 

For now let's get through main repositories of the PeaceFounder project.

## CryptoGroups.jl

## ShuffleProofs.jl

## PeaceFounder.jl

This is where voting system will come together for deployment of mixes, bookeepoing of buletin board, vote collection srervices, different strategies for configuring and proposing ballots and clent side interactions. A CLI interface for all involved parties will be available heere.
