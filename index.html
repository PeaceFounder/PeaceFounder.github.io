The pressure from the public and politicians to have mobile internet voting could end democracies in many countries. It is not far-fetched to compare them to a single ballot box for a nation managed by a small elite. An uncompromised voting alternative system is vitally necessary to change tracks and improve democratic decision-making in ways not previously possible with a paper ballot. This is what PeaceFounder stands for:</p> <ul> <li><p>A strong software-independent voting system where mistakes are an opportunity to learn and can be monitored with publicly available data</p> <li><p>Privacy is ensured through a cascade of mixes which do not need to be trusted, and one of them can be your desktop computer</p> <li><p>Versatile and innovative ballots:</p> <ul> <li><p>cardinal, preferential voting is possible</p> <li><p>complex ballots with budget constraints</p> <li><p>statistical ballots where a large ballot is split into smaller ones and assigned verifiably random to anonymous voters reducing repetitive work and amplifying each voter&#39;s responsibility</p> <li><p>ability for voters to change their votes after elections making untrusted representatives lose their seats and making them more accountable to society</p> </ul> <li><p>Accessible trust for voters. Every voter can see their vote is cast as intended and counted as cast and can do vote counting and auditing elections themselves.</p> <li><p>Trusted party-free design.</p> <li><p>Unstoppable and defendable elections by third parties.</p> <li><p>Extendable with specialised hardware to support coercion resistance.</p> </ul> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > &copy; Janis Erdmanis.
