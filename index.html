The pressure from the public and politicians to have mobile internet voting could end democracies in many contexts. It is not far-fetched to compare existing e-voting solutions to a single ballot box for a nation managed by a small elite. An uncompromised voting alternative system is vitally necessary to change direction and improve democratic decision-making in ways not previously possible with a paper ballot. This is what PeaceFounder stands for:</p> <ul> <li><p>A strong software-independent voting system where mistakes are an opportunity to learn and can be monitored with publicly available data;</p> <ul> <li><p>Trusted party-free design with public auditability and complete transparency;</p> <li><p>Unstoppable, monitorable and defendable elections by third parties;</p> <li><p>Accessible trust for voters. Every voter can see their vote is cast as intended and counted as cast and can do vote counting and auditing elections themselves.</p> </ul> <li><p>Privacy through a cascade of mixes runs one at a time and does not need to be trusted or coordinated; </p> <li><p>Versatile and innovative ballots:</p> <ul> <li><p>cardinal, preferential voting;</p> <li><p>complex ballots with budget constraints;</p> <li><p>sampled ballots where a large ballot is split into smaller ones and assigned verifiably random to anonymous voters reducing repetitive work and amplifying each voter&#39;s responsibility;</p> <li><p>the ability for voters to change their votes after elections making untrusted representatives lose their seats and making them more accountable to society.</p> </ul> <li><p>Made with integration into existing webpages, forums in mind;</p> <li><p>Extendable with specialised hardware to support coercion resistance.</p> </ul> <p>In summary, if you use an e-voting solution on a website, you will benefit in transparency, security and privacy by using PeaceFounder with little to lose in usability.</p> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > &copy; Janis Erdmanis.
