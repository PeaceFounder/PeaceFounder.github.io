Unlike paper systems that require physical access to many locations, centralized e-voting creates attractive targets for large-scale fraud that's easier to execute and conceal.</p> </div> <div class=problem-item > <h4>Decryption Ceremony Limits Privacy</h4> <p>E-voting systems depending on threshold decryption ceremonies face a fundamental dilemma: technical errors by participants may leave election results permanently unencrypted, while low thresholds allow small corrupt minorities to break privacy guarantees.</p> </div> <div class=problem-item > <h4>Lack of Everlasting Privacy</h4> <p>Most E2E systems rely on computational privacy assumptions that may be broken by future cryptographic advances or quantum computing. This limitation is often compensated by eliminating eligibility verifiability and/or withholding election evidence from the public.</p> </div> <div class=problem-item > <h4>Authority-Dependent Verifiability</h4> <p>Even in properly deployed E2E systems, verification capabilities remain concentrated with election authorities, requiring voters to trust institutional honesty and competence rather than enabling independent verification. This leads voters to ask a pertinent question: If vote results have been manipulated, why wouldn't one also corrupt the vote verification process?</p> </div> <div class=problem-item > <h4>Vote Buying and Coercion Risks</h4> <p>Systems that provide voters with receipts or verification tokens create opportunities for vote buying and coercion, as voters can prove how they voted to third parties, undermining the secret ballot principle fundamental to democratic elections. The risk is even more amplified when the vote buyer can remain fully anonymous.</p> </div> </div> <div class=quote-box > If voters cannot independently verify that their votes are accurately counted while maintaining their privacy‚Äîregardless of whether administrators are honest or corrupt‚Äîthen the system has failed its fundamental democratic purpose. <div class=cta-buttons  style="margin-top: 2rem;"> <a href="/problem" class="btn btn-secondary">Read Full Analysis</a> </div> </div> <p class=problem-conclusion > The solution is not to eliminate technology, but to democratize participation in deployment and verification, empowering voters to independently verify their votes without depending on institutional promises. </p> </div> </section> <section class="section innovation-section" id=inovation > <div class=container > <h2>Solving E-voting's Central Problem</h2> <p class=section-subtitle >Unconditional Verifiability Without Compromising Ballot Secrecy</p> <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.2rem; margin-bottom: 3rem;"> PeaceFounder achieves what current e-voting systems cannot: voters can independently verify their votes were accurately counted and the tally was formed from eligible voters‚Äîwithout trusting vendors or authorities. </p> <div class=innovation-grid > <div class=innovation-card > <div class=icon >‚úì</div> <h4>E2E Verifiable</h4> <p>Complete end-to-end verification from vote casting through final tally, with software-independent evidence</p> </div> <div class=innovation-card > <div class=icon >üõ°Ô∏è</div> <h4>Receipt Free</h4> <p>Complete protection against vote buying and coercion while maintaining full verifiability</p> </div> <div class=innovation-card > <div class=icon >üîí</div> <h4>Everlasting Privacy</h4> <p>Vote secrecy maintained even against future quantum computers and cryptographic breakthroughs</p> </div> <div class=innovation-card > <div class=icon >üéØ</div> <h4>Centralized Deployment</h4> <p>Clear responsibilities and simplified accountability.

Anyone can participate as a braider by providing zero-knowledge proofs of honest behavior, ensuring voters' anonymity. </p> </div> <div class=step > <div class=step-number >2</div> <h4>Cast Your Vote</h4> <p> Your voting device retrieves the voting proposal containing the braided generator and voting options. Once you make your selection, your voting calculator creates cryptographic commitments to your vote and tracker preimages, and pseudonymously signs the envelope, which your voting device delivers anonymously to the bulletin board. </p> </div> <div class=step > <div class=step-number >3</div> <h4>Isolate and Verify</h4> <p> After voting phase ends, your unique challenge appears on the bulletin board next to your pseudonym. Entering this challenge in your isolated voting calculator computes your tracker, with which you can locate your vote on the tally board. To maintain receipt-freeness, you can configure your calculator to display any alternative tracker from the tally board. </p> </div> </div> <div class=key-insight > Every previous e-voting system faced an impossible choice: give voters receipts (enabling vote buying) or trust authorities (enabling fraud). PeaceFounder is the first to escape this paradox entirely. </div> </div> </section> <footer id=contact > <div class=container > <div class=footer-links > <a href="/">About</a> <a href="/solution">Research</a> <a href="/downloads/#research_development_roadmap">Roadmap</a> <a href="https://peacefounder.org/PeaceFounder.jl/dev/">Documentation</a> <a href="https://github.com/PeaceFounder">GitHub</a> </div> <p>&copy; 2025 PeaceFounder.
